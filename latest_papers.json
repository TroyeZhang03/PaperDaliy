    "title": "Unique Lives, Shared World: Learning from Single-Life Videos",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04085v1",
    "abstract_en": "We introduce the \"single-life\" learning paradigm, where we train a distinct vision model exclusively on egocentric videos captured by one individual. We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.",

    "title": "SimFlow: Simplified and End-to-End Training of Latent Normalizing Flows",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04084v1",
    "abstract_en": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) learn invertible mappings between the data and a Gaussian distribution. Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.",

    "summary_cn": "归一化流（NFs）模型在联合训练变分自编码器（VAE）时，通常面临流程复杂（如额外增噪/去噪）以及因编码器固定导致的生成质量不佳问题。本研究发现，一个简单的解决方案是将VAE编码器预测的方差固定为常数（如0.5）。这种方法不仅避免了复杂的噪声设计，使解码器能直接从增强的隐变量分布中重建清晰图像，还简化了训练目标，实现了VAE与NF的稳定联合训练。在ImageNet 256x256生成任务上，所提模型SimFlow取得了优于现有最佳方法（gFID 2.15 vs 2.40）的成绩，并可与表征对齐方法结合，将gFID进一步提升至1.91。",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04083v1",
    "abstract_en": "We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04082v1",
    "abstract_en": "Graphic design forms the cornerstone of modern visual communication, serving as a vital medium for promoting cultural and commercial events. Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.",

    "abstract_en": "We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \\{1^c, 2^c, \\dots, N^c\\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \\not \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \\to \\infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\\{p^c : \\textrm{$p$ prime}\\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.",
