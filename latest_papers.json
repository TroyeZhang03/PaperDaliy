    "title": "Anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid for Coulomb interacting generalized Weyl fermions",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17666v1",
    "abstract_en": "Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n>1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \\emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.",

    "title": "OpenEarthAgent: A Unified Framework for Tool-Augmented Geospatial Agents",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17665v1",
    "abstract_en": "Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.",

    "title": "Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664v1",
    "abstract_en": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.",

    "abstract_en": "HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ (\"Has the person ever been at this place?\") and $isAt$ (\"Is the person located at this place around publication time?\") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.",

We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.",
